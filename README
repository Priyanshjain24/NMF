** Audio Source Separation Using Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) **

The task of single channel audio source separation, which consists in isolating the different audio sources present in a mixture signal. 
This can be used in several applications from distinguishing the different music instruments in an orchestra recording to speech
enhancement by separating relevant information of a speaker and the background noise.

This repo implements a python program that allows us to extracts the played notes from a short piano sequence.

The files named "NMF.ipynb" contains the notebook used for source seperation of a mix of 'piano notes'.
The audio file called 'piano_mix.wav' and 'new.wav' was used for audio seperation.
Project report is saved as 'Report.pdf'
